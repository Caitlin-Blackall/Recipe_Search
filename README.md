# Recipe Search

*Completed June 2023*

## Project Overview
This project was part of the Code First Girls course that I 
completed. The project was a joint project that I completed 
with one other girl. We were provided with a project brief 
as below.

#### Project Brief:
In this project you'll create a program to search for recipes 
based on an ingredient. The standard project uses the 
Edamam Recipe API, but can be changed to use a different 
API after completing the required tasks.

These are the required tasks for this project. 
You should aim to complete these tasks before adding your 
own ideas to the project.
1. Read the Edamam API documentation â˜… https://developer.edamam.com/edamam-docs-recipe-api
2. Ask the user to enter an ingredient that they want to search for
3. Create a function that makes a request to the Edamam API with the required ingredient as
part of the search query (also included your Application ID and Application Key
4. Get the returned recipes from the API response
5. Display the recipes for each search result

## Installation
### Pre-Requisites:
+ [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/)

### To run ```main.py```:
1. Create [Edamam API account](https://www.edamam.com/signup) to generate 
[app_id](https://developer.edamam.com//admin/applications/) and [app_key](https://developer.edamam.com//admin/applications/)


2. Place app_id and app_key into ```main.py```


3. ```pip install requests```


4. ```python main.py```

### To run ```extension.py```:
1. Create an app on your [Spotify account](https://developers.spotify.com/) 
to generate client_id and client_key


2. Place client_id and client_key into ```extension.py```


3. ```pip install spotipy``` 


4. ```python extension.py```

## Development Process
To begin, my partner and I discussed the MOSCOW for the project 
and what functionality we wanted the program to have. We then 
both worked on the base code individually before coming 
together to discuss our code. We then worked on joining the 
code together and problem-solved challenges together. We then 
discussed extensions to our project and split these equally 
between us. We then finalised our project and presented it 
to the group together.

We received feedback from our course instructors following 
our presentation and were also thrilled to win the project 
competition!

## Learning
### Challenges

**1. Joint project working**
+ This is something neither of us had done before so it was 
initially challenging to decide what each of our roles was 
and to learn how to code in a pair.

+ It was nice to have somebody to bounce ideas off and to 
help debug code.


### New Skills
+ Joint project working
+ Utilising APIs
+ Project presentation

## Conclusion
Overall, it was a great experience to work on a joint project. 
It was a new skill for both of us but I think we worked really 
well together and were able to talk about our code and help 
each other with an issues. We also split the workload evenly 
which was nice and were able to co-present to the group, 
including giving a demonstration of our code!

It was also fantastic to win the competition!
